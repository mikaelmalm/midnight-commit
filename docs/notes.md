# Game Overview
Game should be in 2 parts

1. the "coding round" where the user assigns consultants to projects and the game ticks
2. the "office" where the user can manage their consultants and office. Buy new consultants, upgrade office, train consultants, etc.


## The "coding round"
- Assign consultants to projects
- manage consultant needs (energy, stress, etc.)
- project should have a "x dollas/second" value
    - if a project has a high "x dollas/second" value, it should have higher demands, higher stress, higher energy consumption, etc. 
    - if a project has a low "x dollas/second" value, it should have lower demands, lower stress, lower energy consumption, etc.
- after each round, the consultants should gain xp based on how much they worked. 
    - base xp gain should be 1 xp per second they worked
    - bonus xp should given for finished projects by the consultant


## The "office"
- Upgrade office
    - larger desks (more consultant per project)
    - better coffee machine (faster energy regen)
    - better food (faster stress regen)
    - better internet (faster project completion)
    - larger office (more room for desks)
- Buy new consultants
- Train consultants
